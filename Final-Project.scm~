;;; PART 1

;;; STRUCTURAL INDUCTION PROOF:
;;; BASIS:
;;; A symbol contains no operators so the result is vacuously true

;;; INDUCTION HYPOTHESIS (IH):
;;; Assume that for each component in the proposition currently under consideration, we have already
;;; re-written the component into a logically equivalent proposition using just OR (v) and NOT (~) operators

;;; INDUCTION STEP (IS):
;;; Consider a proposition P. There are 4 cases:

;;; 1. P = (R v S); R and S are components
;;; By the IH, R' is the re-written proposition that is logically equivalent to R, where R' is expressed using only
;;; the OR (v) and NOT (~) operators. Similarly, S' is the re-written proposition that is logically equivalent to S,
;;; where S' is expressed using only the OR (v) and NOT (~) operators.
;;; (R v S) is then logically equivalent to (R' v S') so all we need to do is call the make-and constructor on R' and
;;; S' to re-write (R v S).

;;; 2. P = (R ^ S)
;;; (R ^ S) is logically equivalent to (R' v S'), where by the IH, R' and S' are re-written propositions that are
;;; logically equivalent to R and S, respectively, using only OR (^) and NOT (~) operators.
;;; Now, all that's needed to be done is to call convert-or function that will convert (R' ^ S') to the logically
;;; equivalent proposition ~(~R' v ~S').

;;; 3. P = ~R
;;; To reiterate, by the IH, R' is the re-written proposition that is logically equivalent to R, where R' is
;;; expressed using only the OR (v) and NOT (~) operators. So, ~R is logically equivalent to ~R'.
;;; Then, all that's left to do is to call the make-not constructor on R'.

;;; 4. P = (R => S)
;;; (R => S) is logically equivalent to (R' => S'), where by the IH, R' and S' are re-written propositions that are
;;; logically equivalent to R and S, respectively, using only OR (v) and NOT (~) operators. All that's left now to
;;; do is to call convert-imply function on (R' => S') to convert it to the logically equivalent proposition
;;; (~R' v S').

;;; DESIGN IDEA
;;; iterative procedure
;;; Check every pair of of association list, say current pair = (car alist), for the termination, if x is the first element of current pair,
;;; then it will terminates and return the value of second elements of current pair, and if we check through the list, the x does not appear
;;; in any pair of the association list

;;; PROOF
;;; we let original association list to be ALIST, 
;;; guess invariant: x appears in any pair of original ALIST iff x appears in alist

;;; Strong enough? when the program start, alist = ALIST, then our GI is true.
;;; Weak enough? when the program terminates, as we mentioned in design idea, there are two cases cause the program terminates
;;;   1. x was found in current head pair of alist, x must appears in the same pair of ALIST, then our GI is true
;;;   2. alist contains only a element of a pair and x is not appear in the pair, x is not in the orignal ALIST, our GI is true
;;; Preservable? We assume that GI is true before each iterative call, while the program does not terminates, that means x is not in current head pair,
;;;   and alist does contains at least 2 pairs, then for the next call new alist becomes (cdr alist), then our GI: x appears in any pair of ALIST iff x
;;;   appears in alist still maintained, since previous head pair does not contains x.

;;; STRUCTURAL INDUCTION PROOF:

;;; Let P to be the least class that contains all the infix propersition

;;; BASIS:
;;; If the proposition is just a symbol, then we can directly check alist using lookup function. Since we assume our alist to be valid
;;; that is, every symbol x appears in e can be founded with its associated value in alist, so (lookup e alist) will return the boolean
;;; value of e when e is a symbol which is correct.

;;; INDUCTION HYPOTHESIS (IH)
;;; For any porposition p \in P, assume the value of all the components of p are true

;;; INDUCTION STEP:
;;; Here we have 2 cases:
;;;  1. p is a infix proposition with 2 operands (in other words, p is either an AND (^), OR (v), or IMPLY (=>)
;;;     proposition). r and s are components of p that p = (r op s). By the IH, we know the value of r and s are all true. 
;;;     Then, since we have all the corrected value of r and s, then the value of p is going to be (operator (value of r) (value of s))
;;;     which is true
;;;  2. p is an infix proposition with only one operand (p is NOT (-)). let r to be a component of p that p = -r. By the IH,
;;;     we know the value of r is true. then the value of p is going to be (not (value of r)) which is correct!
